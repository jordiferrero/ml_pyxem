Importing Libraries

Pyxem v0.13.0: utils.sim_utils removed, instead use the relevant diffsims functionality (get_diffraction_pattern)
Hyperspy v1.3: GUI not installed by default, had to install hyperspy_gui_ipywidgets and hyperspy_gui_traitsui packages

Initialization

Questions
1. Where are the calibration values from?/Does it need to be reoptimized every time?
2. Can't find documentation on 'create_diffraction_library'?
